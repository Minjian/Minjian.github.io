                      <p><b>Work Description: </b></p>
                      <p>Participated in the design and implementation of the following projects for the <a href="https://www.silabs.com/wireless/zigbee" target="_blank">Silicon Labs (SiLabs) Zigbee Stack</a>:</p>
                      <p>2021: </p>
                      <p>• Zigbee on SLC: <a href="https://siliconlabs.github.io/slc-specification" target="_blank"><b>SLC (Silicon Labs Configurator)</b></a> is a metadata specification for <a href="https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk" target="_blank"><b>Silicon Labs SDKs</b></a>. It also describes methods of creating and configuring embedded software projects for Silicon Labs IoT devices. My resposibility in this project is to lead the "Zigbee Host/NCP migration" part to make Silabs Zigbee Host/NCP apps SLC-compatible. Major upgrades include: new project & component metadata files, new command line interface, new event system, and improved app init & system tick logic. The goal of moving Silabs Zigbee apps to SLC is to adapt a more developer-friendly and modern software design pattern so as to improve the developers' experience and the scalability of the Zigbee stack.</p>
                      <p>• Zigbee R23 SLCification: Zigbee R23 is the next revison of Zigbee Spec with several security, commissioning and routing improvements, e.g. DLK (Dynamic Link Key) Negotiation, TLV (Tag Length Value) processing, etc. My responsibility is to lead the "Zigbee R23 SLCification" project to componentize R23 features and port the R23 stack codes to be SLC-compatible.</p>
                      <p>2020: </p>
                      <p>• Multi PAN: a SiLabs proprietary Zigbee feature that allows a device to operate on multiple Zigbee networks. These Zigbee networks are able to have different PAN IDs, security levels, and topologies. A multi-PAN device is able to serve different roles in different networks, for example, being the coordinator of network 1 and being a sleepy end device of network 2, or being coordinators of both networks at the same time, etc.</p>
                      <p>• Link Key Retrieval: a SiLabs proprietary Zigbee feature that dynamically retrieves the correct link key used by sending APS encrypted messages with NodeID even when the NodeID of a specific device keeps changing.</p>
                      <p>2019: </p>
                      <p>• EmberZNet Serial Protocol (EZSP) v8.0: EZSP is used by a host application processor to interact with the Zigbee stack running on a Network Co-Processor (NCP). A new frame format has been introduced to reorganize frame segments so that both EZSP frame control and EZSP frame ID are extended from 1 byte to 2 bytes but the total length of each frame is the same as before.</p>
                      <p>• Works With All Hubs (WWAH) Test Harness: WWAH was announced by CSA in May 2019 and is a set of features focusing on manageability, security, and reliability. SiLabs WWAH Test Harness is an automation test tool and contains a set of python scripts corresponding to each test case specified in the WWAH Test Case Specification.</p>
                      <p>More projects are coming!</p>
